## Project Overview 
<p>The Attendance Monitoring System for the Faculty of Information and Computer Studies of the University of Santo Tomas is a system that would help monitor and keep track of the daily and weekly attendance of the faculty members.</p>

<p>The reason for the study is to automate the current attendance system being implemented in the UST-ICS Faculty Department. Since the faculty currently uses a logbook which is checked on a weekly basis by the Department Head Chair Persons, it is susceptible to physical damage, record loss, inaccurate timestamp and record mismatch. This study will help the department to systematize and manage records of the faculty members with efficiency and brevity. Through this, attendance will be easily monitored, reports will be simply be generated and will give a lesser workload for the professors and staffs, thus giving more time to other important matters in the university.
</p>

<p>The scope focuses on the professorâ€™s daily attendance and without the basis of his or her class schedule. The process excludes the time when the faculty member checked in/out since it is the culture of faculty, as well a requirement of the client. Another is on how the weekly reports are processed and stored to ensure availability and confidentiality. Lastly, is to make the whole process fast and orderly.</p>

<p>The target beneficiary of the system would be the UST Information and Computer Studies Department; mainly the chair persons of each department which of the Computer Science Department Head Chair Person, Information Technology Department Head Chair Person and Information Systems Department Head Chair. Other indirect beneficiaries would be the UST Accounting department which handles the payroll system and partly the UST administration which handles the University professors.</p>
